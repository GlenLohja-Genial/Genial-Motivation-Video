                <h1>Below u can find my motivation letter.</h1>
                <p>
                    I understand that there are a lot of applicants for this master&apos;s degree, but I am sure I am the right applicant for this programme. 
                    Writing this letter, I am excited to apply because I&apos;ve been interested for quite some time now. 
                    Ever since I came across this programme I was really interested because it is a merge of some of the most promising job opportunities in our market
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a young person from a country like Albania, where these kinds of degrees are relatively new, I believe that this is the right choice for my future,
                     and this programme is the best for what I want to achieve in my career. After analysing the curriculum,
                      the subject that I am most interested is Intelligent Systems and Robotics. 
                      In this day and age, I think that this will be the future of humanity and I want to be a person that helps us advance on this aspect 
                      and make our life easier with the possibilities that technology gives us. What I appreciate the most is the opportunity that 
                      this programme gives us to have different experiences from various universities. 
                      This is a great experience for someone young and full of energy like me, who would love to see the working culture from different countries.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As you can see from my CV, I have had different kind of experiences in programming and my knowledge of programming languages is an asset for this degree, 
                    I believe. I want to see what I can achieve after this degree, that I am sure it will open new doors for me. 
                    In today&apos;s world technology is an inseparable part of our lives and I believe that it will overtake the way that we function even more with time,
                     so that Is why I am so invested in specializing in it. In Albania there aren&apos;t a lot of opportunities for people like me who want to 
                     learn more in these degrees, even less ones that focus on different aspects, so that is why I want to get the most out of this given experience so 
                     I can help my country which lacks a lot of technological aspects of it, especially because of the difficult economical state that it is in.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ever since I was a little kid, I was passionate about subjects like Mathematics and its problems, 
                    especially the ones that needed a logical solution. 
                    This kind of logical thinking has helped me in every step of the way, and I am sure it will be a big help during my time at your institution. 
                    I am a very dedicated young man and give the most at what I decide to do, so my master&apos;s isn&apos;t any different. 
                    I am just a person with big dreams and the way that this can start to be fulfilled is by you taking a chance and believing in my potential.
                     I am sure it won&apos;t be long that these dreams will become true with your help that jump start my career.
                </p>

                    Thank you for taking my application into consideration.
